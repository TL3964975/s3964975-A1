  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px"> My name is Tom Lucchese. I am 25 years of age and currently living in Sydney New South Wales (NSW), Australia. My student ID for RMIT is s3964975. I was born in Sydney, NSW, Australia, however I have Italian Heritage. My Nonno (Italian for Grandpa) was born on an island in the south of Italy called Lipari. He then moved to Australia when he was 18 to study medicine where he met my Nonna (Italian for Grandma). I have completed a Bachelor of Environmental Science 4 years ago, but I have spent the last 3 years working at my first job which is being a Client Service Specialist at a Taxi company where I assist clients and the general public with being able to travel with Taxis Australia wide. This job has been great for me to build up my skills with talking to others and not be nervous when making a phone call! I can be contacted on my university email which is <a href="mailto:s3964975@student.rmit.edu.au">s3964975@student.rmit.edu.au</a>
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I love animals and have a few pets at home as well which I adore. I currently have a dog named Lucy and two Quaker Parrots. Lucy is a Miniature Schnauzer and is 14 years old and has been with me since primary school. She sometimes shows her age but that doesn’t stop her from wanting to go on walks and barking for food when she wants chicken!
I also have two Quaker Parrots. Both parrots are very young. Tyrene (the blue parrot) is around 3 years old and loves my younger brother. Tweety (the yellow quaker) is only 1 and a bit years old. She loves her food and especially anything that looks green! Both parrots get along really well as you can see in the below picture where they are snuggling up to each other for afternoon naps.

  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">Since I was in year 6 in primary, I participated in a martial arts sports called ‘Tae-Kwon-Do’ and continued with the sport up until my school days were completed. This sport focuses on disipline and mainly involves kicking rather than punching and also invoves some self defence. I am internationally recognised as a 1st dan black belt which is a higher grade than a normal black belt and at the time participated in tournaments which I won bronze, silver and a gold medal. Though, I would be a little rusty at the moment though as the last time I practised Tae-Kwon-Do was back in 2014! I personally wouldn’t mind finding a Dojo in which I enjoy going to get back to practising, especially with others who have the same passion.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I am also interested in Ancient Egypt and have been interested in its history ever since I was young. I have always been fascinated by their gods and goddesses (like Anubis and Horus for example) as well as the herioglyphics and the art that can be seen on tomb walls and temples. I do love reading stories and watching documentaries about anything related to the ancient history whether it be things about the Old Kingdom, interpretting the heiroglyph texts to new findings from those excavating Egypt currently.</p>
