    <h1 style="font-size: 40px; text-align: center">'Bird Keeper App (Pocket Pet Guide)'</h1>
    <h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center">Overview</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I would like to develop an application accessible on tablets and mobile phones called ‘Pocket Pet Guide’. This app would be for new and current bird owners who may need to quickly search a question about keeping a bird as a pet with a range of different types of information to help bird owners keep their feathery friend happy and healthy. It would be beneficial for those looking to get a pet bird for the first time as it would go through the ropes of caring for a feathery friend and from there, users of the app could determine if it’s right for them.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center">Motivation for the idea</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">There are a lot of pet birds in Australia. The journal <em>‘Pets in Australia: A national Survey of Pets in Australia 2019’</em> mentions there was an estimate of 5.6 million pet birds in Australia which equated to around 9 - 10% of pet owners in Australia. That’s still many pet birds in Australia! They are mainly kept as companions to their owners, but some keep chickens for their own source of eggs. The types of birds that are kept as pets range from finches, canaries, parakeets, chickens and even larger birds like cockatoos and Macaws. </p>
  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">For first time owners like myself, it was a little difficult and time consuming initially finding out how to look after my feathery companion and it would sometimes take multiple searches to find the answer I needed. I am very happy with my Quaker Parrot Tweety and I cherish the time I am able to spend with her. Unfortunately, however, this isn’t always the case with bird owners and some who find it overwhelming or not for them, do take their bird back to the pet store or rehome them which can have negative impacts on their mental health. I do believe that there will be people interested in this kind of app as it can assist with a very important decision in a person’s life in considering adopting a feathery companion.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align:center">Description of the App</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">The Guide on keeping Birds will be almost like Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), but instead will be an educational app and contain a plethora of content for new and current bird owners. It will also be categorised by the different species of birds that are kept as pets. Once a category is clicked, a new page will appear, and the top of the page will show a picture of the species selected as well as a brief overview about that selected bird. Below the overview will be the different topics on how to look after their new companion. These topics will contain information for the user to read, some FAQs that should cover questions that are frequently asked and some visual and interactive material relevant to the topic to help keep the user interested (more of this will be covered below). These topics will range from good and bad foods, how to train your bird, body language and what signs to look for and what to do when your avian companion is sick. As well as general information such as a bird to cage size ratio, how much time you need to spend with them per day and if they can be trained. This information will be sorted in categories such as beginner for basic information and understanding of the bird and how to keep them, to intermediate and advanced for more complex tips and information.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">The app will also have a quiz for each topic that is covered for the species of parrot that the user has selected. This quiz will be a multiple-choice questionnaire for the user if they wish to test their knowledge on the selected species and how to look after them. It can be attempted multiple times so that the user can feel confident in achieving a perfect score and that they are able to really think about adding a feathery friend to the family. Questions will be based on the material that is already provided in the guide but will alter slightly as things may differ from each bird such as cage requirements or social settings. </p>
  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">Part of the content present in the app may have visual features like recommended videos from Youtube that are related to the topic where the user can learn visually what life is like with a parrot. These videos would probably be more tips and tricks to enhance the quality of your relationship with the parrot but will also be on topic to and relevant to what the user is reading. The visual aspect may also have an interactive tutorial in a form of a simulation or a game where it will ask you to perform certain tasks with a simulated bird that are a part of everyday life with a pet bird like feeding it the correct food and teaching it ‘step up’ for example. The simulation aims to be a fun experience while simultaneously educational especially with young children. It ultimately aims to help families decide if this is the right choice for them.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center">Tools Required</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I will need to have access to the MIT App Inventor to get started in learning how to turn my idea above into an app and this may take some time learning and getting used to. I will also need to know how to use Unity or Unreal Engine or similar game making software to be able to create the game like simulation that I had in mind and implement it into the application. I will also need both an Apple and Android phone and potentially tablets to test the application and ensure that it runs very well on both platforms.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center">Skills Required</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I will need to have learnt any application creation software such as MIT app inventor and have the experience to use it. I will need to do the same for software this is used to make games. I would need to stick to learning software which is easy to use to start with which will still take time for me to acquire the skill. I will also need to acquire mobile phones to use as test devices for when the time comes for me to test the application. It will be a long road for me to acquire the skills needed to create my idea as an application as I will need to learn multiple tools to be able to start it. It only becomes easy to acquire if I am learning the software quickly or if someone in the team already has the experience with their chosen app and can show me the ropes so that I would be able to contribute. Acquiring the mobile phones should be easy. I have a couple of old and current Android and Apple phones which can be used to test which phones are compatible.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center">Outcome</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">If this project was successful and did get released to the public, I would hope that it would be downloaded by both pet and non-pet owners interested in birds as pets to learn and have a better understanding on how to look after them. I would also like to think that there would be a reduced number of birds being rehomed or even abandoned as more people are being educated and experiencing via a simulation what their home could potentially be like with a pet bird before purchasing one at the pet store with no experience. It would be great if the application was successful and could be expanded or a new app developed to include other kinds of pets like fish, reptiles, amphibians and potentially cats and dogs as considering getting a pet for you or your family can be a very important decision that adds a lot of responsibility but can bring so much joy and positive experiences to your life.</p>
