    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I’m interested in computer hardware as well as games and the internet. My interest began when I was young, I can remember playing a pinball game called ‘Pinball Mania Plus’ on the very first family computer that I can remember. I was always attempting to beat my high scores even if it meant playing the same level or pinball table multiple times. I would even play a round or two with my brothers. Eventually, I started getting interested about computer hardware and eventually became interested in learning more about custom building desktop computers. However, I don't have much experience with really any field in IT, though I am really enjoying making a webpage and it's exciting when the code I type in works and I can see my very first webpage come together!</p>
    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I chose to study at RMIT as I was initially unsure on where to study. I had to apply through UAC through the universities here in Sydney and was not confident that I would be able to get in and study again. I was recommended RMIT by Open Universities Australia and once they mentioned that there were no entry requirements, I immediately wanted to choose RMIT and applied straight away.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I hope to become more knowledgeable in IT as I currently have little experience in any field of IT. I hope to start to learn the basics of most areas in IT such as programming, website development, UI design and experiencing the different software that can be used. I also hope that by studying an introduction to IT that I find an area (such as AI and Robotics for example) interesting and enjoyable so that I start to learn more about the topic even in my own time, learn the programs associated with the field that I enjoy and eventually look for a  job or somewhere to start part time so that I can build on my skills and knowledge whilst getting experience in the workforce in an IT related job.</p>
