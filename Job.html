<p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">A Software Engineer develops, modifies and implements new features to a software product which is either for a client of the business or for the organisation itself. They are also responsible for testing and identifying bugs or problems with the software which would then need to be fixed. They also work with the client and team members to come up with new ideas or features that could benefit the users of the software. These could range from features that could be necessary for the software to work, suggestions / feedback from clients or other departments in the organisation to assist in any improvements or features that may be necessary as well as quality-of-life changes which make using the software easier and more enjoyable for the user.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I find this type of job appealing as I would be able to either develop a new kind of software or implement new features which will be exciting for me especially knowing that other people will be implementing the software, I use in either their daily life or work. I am also used to talking to clients and pitching ideas like a sales pitch as it is like what I am currently doing at my current job. I also do prefer to work with a group and collaborating with others in my team to work to build or improve on a project for me is satisfying.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I would need to learn and use a few more language programs professionally. Java and Python are a few examples that I would need to become familiar with. I would also need experience with coding and programming as I would need to ensure that there are no problems with the code so that the program or software works without any major bugs or problems. I would also need an understanding of algorithms.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I currently have little experience for the job above. I am always open to learning new things and that I do work well with others. I can also talk to clients to pitch an idea or a product which they can potentially use and listen to their feedback. However, I will need to learn language programs like the one I mentioned above. I will also need to understand IT more than I currently do especially with data, algorithms and learning more coding / programming skills. Whilst I also have about 3 years of experience in the work force, I will probably need a little more experience especially working in an IT related job.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">To obtain the above skills, I am currently studying IT at RMIT university. I am starting off with the basics and build up my knowledge in IT and will eventually enrol into more subjects and the degree of Bachelor of Information Technology. Once I complete the degree, I will look to potentially studying programming further and start to learn the language programs starting with Python. After I feel comfortable with Python, I may start to learn Javascript if I haven’t already and may even participate in a course if I’m having trouble. To obtain the experience, I will start to look for a part of full time roll where I build on my skills in the work force in an IT related area.</p>
