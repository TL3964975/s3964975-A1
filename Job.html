<p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">A Software Engineer develops, modifies and implements new features to a software product which is either for a client of a business or for the organisation itself. They are also responsible for testing and identifying potential issues with the software which would then need to be fixed. They also work with the client and team members to come up with new ideas or features that could benefit the users of the software. These could range from features that may be necessary for the software to function such as suggestions and feedback from clients or other departments in the organisation as well as quality-of-life changes which make using the software easier and more enjoyable for the user.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I find this type of job appealing as I would be able to either develop a new kind of software or implement new features, which will be exciting for me especially knowing that other people may use the software that I create in either their daily life or work. I am also used to talking to clients and pitching ideas such as a sales proposal as it is similar to what I am currently doing at my current job. Further, I prefer to work in a team and collaborate with others to build or improve on a project, which for me would be satisfying.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I would need to learn and use a few more language programs professionally. Java and Python are a few examples that I would need to become familiar with. I would also need experience with coding and programming as I would need to ensure that there are no problems with the code so that the program or software works without any major bugs or problems. I would also need an understanding of algorithms.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I currently have little experience for the job above, however I am always open to learning new things and I am confident that I work well with others. I can also interact with clients to pitch an idea or a product which they can potentially use, and in return I can incorporate their feedback where necessary. I would also need to learn and become more familiar with using a few more language programs professionally, such as Java and Python. I would also require experience with coding and programming as I would need to ensure that there are no problems with the code so that the program or software operates efficiently. I will also need to understand IT more than I currently do especially with data, algorithms and learning more coding and programming skills. Whilst I have about three years of experience in the work force, I understand that I will probably need more experience working in an IT related job.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">To obtain the above skills, I am currently studying IT at RMIT University. I am starting off with the basics and build up my knowledge in IT and will eventually enrol into more subjects and the degree of Bachelor of Information Technology. Once I complete the degree, I will potentially seek to expand my understanding of programming and start to learn the language programs including Python. After I feel comfortable with Python, I may advance to Javascript if I haven’t already and may even participate in a course if I’m having trouble. To obtain experience, I will start looking for a part time or full time role where I build on my skills in an IT related area.</p>
