  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">These test results to me are important as they show I have changed since the last time I was studying at university. They show that I am becoming more sociable and willing to meet new people and make new friends. They also reaffirm that I am empathetic to others which I believe to be important especially when working in a group and I also would want others to achieve their best and encourage them in the process. It also confirms my feelings of how I believe I learn best, which is to observe the steps how something is done and trying it myself with a few examples. </p>

  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">The results above show that I am easy going and sociable, meaning I could make a positive impact on the group that I work in. I can also interact with the group whether it is brainstorming ideas, coming up with next steps or having a one-on-one chat with a team member about anything. I will be someone who wants to keep the morale of the team high while working on my own tasks and contributions. If I hear or see that a team member is stressing or has low morale, I know that I will want to communicate with and listen to them, empathise and provide a solution where I can.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #0f0f0f; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">When forming a team, I would potentially need to take into consideration that I learn by doing things and may need someone with more experience than me to show the basics of anything that will be new to me and if it’s not covered in the course itself. I will also be asking lots of questions to the group if there is anything that I am unsure of as I want to have an understanding about the project so that I can make a quality contribution to the team’s project.</p>
